First, you need to install the [Starwhale Client (SWCLI)](../swcli), which can be done by running the following command

```bash
python3 -m pip install starwhale
```

For more information, see the [SWCLI installation guide](../swcli/installation)

Depending on your instance type, there are three getting-started guides available for you:

* [Getting started with Starwhale Standalone](standalone) - This guide helps you run an MNIST evaluation on your desktop PC/laptop. It is the fastest and simplest way to get started with Starwhale.
* [Getting started with Starwhale Server](server) - This guide helps you install Starwhale Server in your data center and run an MNIST evaluation. At the end of the tutorial, you will have a Starwhale Server instance where you can run model evaluations on and manage your datasets and models.
* [Getting started with Starwhale Cloud](cloud) - This guide helps you create an account on Starwhale Cloud and run an MNIST evaluation. It is the easiest way to experience all Starwhale features.
