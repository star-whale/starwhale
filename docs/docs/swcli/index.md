title: Starwhale Client (SWCLI) User Guide
---

The Starwhale Client (SWCLI) is a command-line tool that enables you to interact with Starwhale instances. You can use SWCLI to complete almost all tasks in Starwhale.

SWCLI is written in pure python3 (require Python 3.7+) so that it can be easily installed by the `pip` command.

Currently, SWCLI only supports Linux and macOS. Windows is coming soon.

To install/update SWCLI, see the [SWCLI Installation Guide](installation).

For a list of commands, see the [SWCLI Reference Guide](../reference/swcli).
