title: Project in Starwhale
---

"Project" is the basic unit for organizing different resources like models, datasets, etc.

You may use projects for different purposes. For example, you can create a project for a data scientist team, a product line, or a specific model. Users usually work on one or more projects in their daily lives.

Starwhale Server/Cloud projects are grouped by [accounts](account). Starwhale Standalone does not have accounts. So you will not see any account name prefix in Starwhale Standalone projects.

Starwhale Server/Cloud projects can be either "public" or "private". Public projects means all users on the same instance are assigned a "guest" role to the project by default. For more information about roles, see [Roles and permissions in Starwhale](roles-permissions)

A `self` project is created automatically and configured as the default project in Starwhale Standalone.
